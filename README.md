## Vision Statement

Your vision statement should contain the following information and be formatted as one or more paragraphs.

1. For ... (the productâ€™s target market)
2. Who/That ... (describe what need your product solves)
3. The product ... (product name,or product category)
4. That leads to ... (main advantage, appealing reason for purchase)
5. Unlike the ... (principal competing alternatives)
6. Our product offers ... (describe main differentiation)

# Sprint 1

Each item should link to the actual product, be it a google spreadsheet, google doc, github markdown file, etc. Do not link to a markdown file that contains only a link to another location - link directly from the appropriate item below. Failure to adhere to this criteria wil result in the associated artifact not being graded. Add any additional items required for the specific sprint submission.

For this first sprint, I am anticipating that you will have selected one or two user stories for the Sprint Backlog, and most likely not have completed them since the majority if this week will consist of getting your product backlog, requirements, and development environment fleshed out and stood up. The only implementation I am expecting to see is that your development environment is properly configured to where it can at least run a basic "hello world" type application.

  - [Sequence Diagrams](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=sequence_diagram)
  - etc.

- Automated Tests
- Product Demonstration

For this sprint, I am anticipating that you will continue to work on the stories carried over from Sprint 1, with a focus on the design aspect of your system. I am expecting your architecture document and diagrams to reflect the system only in the context of these user stories, with some generalization to help plan for the other items currently in the backlog. I am not expecting a significant amount of implementation at this point, if any at all.

- [Burndown Chart](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=sprint+burndown+chart)
- [Velocity Chart](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=agile+velocity+chart)
- Design Documents
  - [System Architecture](https://github.com/drhollander/COP4331_Sample/blob/master/artifacts/architecture.md)
  - [Class Diagrams](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=class+diagram)
  - [Sequence Diagrams](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=sequence_diagram)
  - etc.

- [Automated Tests](https://github.com/drhollander/COP4331_Sample/blob/master/project/readme.md)
- [Product Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com)

At this point I am expecting that you have designed out a few of the initial user stories and started to implement this. From this point forward there should be continuous integration and deployment, producing working software that is demoed at the end of each sprint.
